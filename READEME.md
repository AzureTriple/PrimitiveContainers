# PrimitiveContainers
A small Java library containing an assortment of basic array-backed data structures for primitive data types.

This library is designed with flexibility at the highest priority. All the data structures provide direct access to their backing data, which allows users to make complex modifications easily and efficiently. No error checking apart from assert statements are present, however, which means that the user is responsible for rigorously testing modifications to the data structures.
